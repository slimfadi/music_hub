#Personal Music Hub
This is just a little music web app that I created to have a good customized experience listening to my music
see the demo, if you like it or semi like it (wanna do changes on it), feel free to fork and give me feed back
It's built witha a few PHP lines, and jQuery
I'm also using the open source HTML5 mp3 player [jplayer](http://jplayer.org/)

It also uses the Dropbox API to read the music files from the user's dropbox

##Installation
Coming soon...
